    <i>"We dont just report, We Reveal". -Theodore Aplasca</i><br />
    Journalism is more than impression. It can draw a sharp line<br />
    between passive reporting and active truth-seeking.<br />
    The voice of every Journalist digs deeper in uncovering mysteries,<br />
    hidden stories, exposing injustice, and amplifying the voice of the
    voiceless.
